            <div class="characteristics">Some key characteristics of otters include:</div>
            <div class="list-first">1. Semi-Aquatic Lifestyle: Otters are well-adapted to both land and water. They spend much of their time in aquatic environments, such as rivers, lakes, marshes, and coastal waters.</div>
            <div class="list">2. Swimming Abilities: Otters are excellent swimmers and use their streamlined bodies and webbed feet to propel themselves through water with great agility. They can swim swiftly and gracefully, diving and staying underwater for extended periods.</div>
            <div class="list">3. Social Creatures: Many otter species are social animals, living in family groups called "rafts" or "holts." They engage in playful behaviors, such as sliding down riverbanks, chasing each other, and engaging in mock fights.</div>
            <div class="list">4. Communication: Otters communicate with various vocalizations, including whistles, growls, and chirps. They also use body language and scent markings to convey information to other otters.</div>
            <div class="list">5. Diverse Species: There are different species of otters found in various parts of the world. Some well-known species include the North American river otter, European otter, Asian small-clawed otter, giant otter, and sea otter.</div>

                    Otters are among the few animals known to use tools. They have been observed using rocks to break open shellfish, clams, and crabs.
                     They place a rock on their chest or stomach and use it to crack open their prey by pounding it against a hard surface.

                <div class="Curiosities-text">
                    Otters have incredibly dense fur, consisting of two layers: an outer layer of long guard hairs and a thick layer of insulating underfur. This fur is essential for their survival as it keeps them warm in cold water. Unfortunately, this luxurious fur also made them a target for the fur trade in the past.

                    Otters are exceptionally agile swimmers. They have webbed feet and a long, sleek body that enables them to glide effortlessly through water. They are capable of reaching speeds of up to 7 miles per hour (11 km/h) while swimming.

                    Otters have a varied diet depending on their habitat and species. They are skilled hunters, and their diet can include fish, crustaceans, amphibians, birds, and small mammals. Sea otters, in particular, are known for using rocks to dislodge prey from the ocean floor.

                <div class="Curiosities-text">
                    To stay submerged underwater, otters have a unique method of conserving oxygen. Before diving, they take a deep breath and then close their nostrils and ears. They can also store air in their fur, creating air pockets that help them float and stay underwater longer.
